Welcome to hydraulic simulation system of Mirage 2000.. Mirage 2000 consists of two independent circuits for hydraulic power generation, which is same in both single seater and two seater, switching to circuit 1, it consists of following components,
Resourvoir 1, having total capacity 9 Litres, which stores hyraulic fluid required for operation of various services, and to provide fluid to the pump with a positive feed, it has two micro switches, one micro switch operates RSVR 1 light in refuelling panel, when hyraulic level drops below 7 litres in the resourvoir, next duel micro-switch at 3.7 litres, when fuel drops below marking, it stimulates the electric current passing through solonoid. activates the anciallary isolation valve 12 M,
Next self regulating pump, its purpose is to deliver pressurised Hydraulic fluid, required for operation of various systems and components, and it starts or stops delivery automatically, as a function of system requirement, the pump is installed on Aircraft accessory GearBox, output pressure of pump is self regulated to 280 bar at 0 output, or 270 bar at an output of 112 litres per minutes at 6100 RPM,
Next Bypass valve, during the initial starting phase of the engine, the pump output pressure is released by bypass valve, this is in order to shed the pump load on to the AGB,
Next HP connecting block, which consist of NRV, a filter capacity of 25 microns, and two pressure switches, the switch 11 D will sense a drop in pressure below 195 bar, and after 2 seconds time delay, it illuminates HYD 1 warning on 1 W panel, the pressure switch 144 C senses a drop-in pressure below 180 bar, and illuminate SLATS warning light in 1 W panel,
Next Servo accumulator, NRV provided at the inlet of accumulator, prevents the pressure from droping in the accumulator, if there is a pressure drop at pump delivery, the diaphragm divides accumulator in two chambers, bottom chamber has a fuel capacity of 2 litres, and upper chamber is charged with nitrogen at 140 bar pressure,
Now, moving forward to some minor components of the circuit, starting with self sealing coupling, which is used to connect HST, next ancillary isolation valve, 12M, it cut-off the hydraulic fluid supply to the anciallary services, if the resourvoir level comes below 3.7 litres, the energization of valve is done by a duel microswitch in the reservoir,
5D pressure switch senses pressure in servo accumulator line, and enables LH needle of 3D gauge to read this pressure, simillarily, 7D pressure switch sense pressure in anciallary line, and enable LH needle of 3D gauge to read this pressure
next pressure switch 211C senses a drop of pressure below 30 bar and gives a signal to ultimate back-up box, next heat exchanger, the return hyraulic fluid from essential services is returned to the reservoir through it, next return filter, a paper filter of 10 microns capacity with a clogging indicator,
next HP pressure relief valve, if pressure in the system exceeds 312 bar, HP pressure relief valve will relief the excessive pressure to reservoir return line,
next LP sampling valve provided in the return line, for taking hydraulic sample,
next reservoir relief valve, if the pressure in LP chamber exceeds 10 bar, the pressure relief valve operates and relief the excessive pressure...
